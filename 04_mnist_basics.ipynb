We'll use one of the most famous datasets in computer vision, [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), for our experiments. MNIST contains hand-written digits, collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and collated into a machine learning dataset by Yann Lecun and his colleagues. Lecun used MNIST in 1998 to demonstrate [Lenet 5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/), the first computer system to demonstrate practically useful recognition of hand-written digit sequences. This was one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of AI."

    "The story of deep learning is one of tenacity and grit from a handful of dedicated researchers. After early hopes (and hype!) neural networks went out of favor in the 1990's and 2000's, and just a handful of researchers kept trying to make them work well. Three of them, Yann Lecun, Geoff Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio were awarded the highest honor in computer science, the Turing Award (generally considered the \"Nobel Prize of computer science\") after triumphing despite the deep skepticism and disinterest of the wider machine learning and statistics community.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/turing_300.jpg\" id=\"dl_fathers\" caption=\"Left to right, Yann Lecun, Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio\" alt=\"Picture of Yann Lecun, Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoff Hinton has told of how even academic papers showing dramatically better results than anything previously published would be rejected from top journals and conferences, just because they used a neural network. Yann Lecun's work on convolutional neural networks, which we will study in the next section, showed that these models could read hand-written text--something that had never been achieved before. However his breakthrough was ignored by most researchers, even as it was used commercially to read 10% of the checks in the US!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these three Turing Award winners, there are many other researchers who have battled to get us to where we are today. For instance, Jurgen Schmidhuber (who many believe should have shared in the Turing Award) pioneered many important ideas, including working on the *LSTM* architecture with his student Sepp Hochreiter (widely used for speech recognition and other text modeling tasks, and used in the IMDb example in <<chapter_intro>>). Perhaps most important of all, Paul Werbos in 1974 invented back-propagation for neural networks, the technique shown in this chapter and used universally for training neural networks ([Werbos 1994](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Roots_of_Backpropagation.html?id=WdR3OOM2gBwC)). His development was almost entirely ignored for decades, but today it is the most important foundation of modern AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lesson here for all of us! On your deep learning journey you will face many obstacles, both technical, and (even more difficult) people around you who don't believe you'll be successful. There's one *guaranteed* way to fail, and that's to stop trying. We've seen that the only consistent trait amongst every fast.ai student that's gone on to be a world-class practitioner is that they are all very tenacious."

Without starting with a sensible baseline, it is very difficult to know whether your super fancy models are actually any good. One good approach to creating a baseline is doing what we have done here: think of a simple, easy to implement model. Another good approach is to search around to find other people that have solved similar problems to yours, and download and run their code on your dataset. Ideally, try both of these!"

Many Python programmers use them every day, including all of the authors of this book—they are part of \"idiomatic Python\". But programmers coming from other languages may have never seen them before. There are a lot of great tutorials just a web search away, so we won't spend a long time discussing them now. Here is a quick explanation and example to get you started. A list comprehension looks like this: `new_list = [f(o) for o in a_list if o>0]`. This would return every element of `a_list` that is greater than zero, after passing it to the function `f`. There are three parts here: the collection you are iterating over (`a_list`), an optional filter (`if o>0`), and something to do to each element (`f(o)`). It's not only shorter to write but way faster than the alternative ways of creating the same list with a loop."

It all depends on what you happen to have had reason to practice in the meantime. Perhaps you have forgotten what a _square root_ is, or exactly how they work. No problem! Any time you come across a maths concept that is not explained fully in this book, don't just keep moving on, but instead stop and look it up. Make sure you understand the basic idea of what that maths concept is, how it works, and why we might be using it. One of the best places to refresh your understanding is Khan Academy.

Therefore, in this book we will generally use PyTorch tensors instead of NumPy arrays, where possible.

    "A numpy array is multidimensional table of data, with all items of the same type. Since that can be any type at all, they could even be arrays of arrays, with the innermost array potentially being different sizes — this is called a \"jagged array\". By \"multidimensional table\" we mean, for instance, a list (dimension of one), a table or matrix (dimension of two), a \"table of tables\" or a \"cube\" (dimension of three), and so forth. If the items are all of some simple type such as an integer or a float then numpy will store them as a compact C data structure in memory. This is where numpy shines. Numpy has a wide variety of operators and methods which can run computations on these compact structures at the same speed as optimized C, because they are written in optimized C!\n",

    "A PyTorch tensor is nearly the same thing. It, too, is a multidimensional table of data, with all items of the same type. However, they cannot be just any old type — they have to be a basic numeric type. Therefore, a PyTorch tensor cannot be a jagged array. It is always a regularly shaped multidimensional rectangular structure. The vast majority of methods and operators supported by numpy on these structures are also supported by PyTorch. But PyTorch has the very big benefit that these structures can live on the GPU, in which case this computation will be optimised for the GPU. And furthermore, PyTorch can automatically calculate derivatives of these operations, including combinations of them. As you'll see, it would be impossible to do deep learning in practice without this capability.\n",

In a nutshell, it's a low-level  (low-level means more similar to the language that computers use internally) language that is very fast compared to Python. To take advantage of its speed while programming in Python, try to avoid as much as possible writing loops and replace them by commands that work directly on arrays or tensors.\n",

So in this case, we'll get back 1010 absolute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our function calls `mean((-1,-2))`. In Python, `-1` refers to the last element, and `-2` refers to the second last. So in this case, this tells PyTorch that we want to take the mean of the last two axes of the tensor. After taking the mean over the last two axes, we are left with just the first axis, which is why our final size was `(1010)`.\n",

This function will automatically do broadcasting and be applied elementwise, just like all PyTorch functions and operators."

There are certainly other choices we could make, such as initialising them to the percentage of times that that pixel is activated for that category.

We need some function that will return a number that is small if the performance of the model is good, and vice versa (the standard approach is to treat a small loss as good, and a large loss as bad, although this is just a convention)\n",
    "- **Step**:: A simple way to figure out whether a weight should be increased a bit, or decreased a bit, would be just to try it. Increase the weight by a small amount, and see if the loss goes up or down. Once you find the correct direction, you could then change that amount by a bit more, and a bit less, until you find an amount which works well. However, this is slow! As we will see, the magic of calculus allows us to directly figure out which direction, and roughly how much, to change each weight, without having to try all these small changes, by calculating *gradients*. This is just a performance optimisation, we would get exactly the same results by using the slower manual process as well\n",

    "The one magic step is the bit where we calculate the *gradients*. As we mentioned, we can use calculus as a performance optimization; it allows us to more quickly calculate whether our loss will go up or down when we adjust our parameters up or down. In other words, the gradients will tell us how much we have to change each weight to make our model better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you remember back to your high school calculus class: the *derivative* of a function tells you how much a change in the parameters of a function will change its result. Don't worry, lots of us forget our calculus once high school is behind us! But you will have to have some intuitive understanding of what a derivative is before you continue, so if this is all very fuzzy in your head, head over to Khan Academy and complete the lessons on basic derivatives. You won't have to know how to calculate them yourselves, you just have to know what a derivative is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point about a derivative is this: for any function, such as the quadratic function we saw before, we can calculate its derivative. The derivative is another function. It calculates the change, rather than the value. For instance, the derivative of the quadratic function at the value three tells us how rapidly the function changes at the value three. More specifically, you may remember from high school that gradient is defined as \"rise/run\", that is, the change in the value of the function, divided by the change in the value of the parameter. When we know how our function will change, then we know what we need to do to make it smaller. This is the key to machine learning: having a way to change the parameters of a function to make it smaller. Calculus provides us with a computational shortcut, the derivative, which lets us directly calculate the gradient of our functions."

But there is nothing mathematically tricky here; you can calculate the derivative with respect to one weight, and treat all the other ones as constant. Then repeat that for each weight. This is how all of the gradients are calculated, for every weight.\n",

Amazingly enough, PyTorch is able to automatically compute the derivative of nearly any function! What's more, it does it very fast.

Often, people select a learning rate just by trying a few, and finding which results in the best model after training (we'll show you a better approach later in this book, called the *learning rate finder*).

    "To summarize, at the beginning, the weights of our model can be random (training *from scratch*) or come from of a pretrained model (*transfer learning*). In the first case, the output we will get from our inputs won't have anything to do with what we want, and even in the second case, it's very likely the pretrained model won't be very good at the specific task we are targeting. So the model will need to *learn* better weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will compare the outputs the model gives us with our targets (we have labelled data, so we know what result the model should give) using a *loss function*, which returns a number that needs to be as low as possible. Our weights need to be improved. To do this, we take a few data items (such as images) that we feed to our model. After going through our model, we compare to the corresponding targets using our loss function. The score we get tells us how wrong our predictions were, and we will change the weights a little bit to make it slightly better.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find how to change the weights to make the loss a bit better, we use calculus to calculate the *gradient* (actually, we let PyTorch do it for us!) Let's imagine you are lost in the mountains with your car parked at the lowest point. To find your way, you might wander in a random direction but that probably won't help much. Since you know you your vehicle is at the lowest point, you would be better to go downhill. By always taking a step in the direction of the steepest slope, you should eventually arrive at your destination. We use the gradient to tell us how big a step to take; specifically, we multiply the gradient by a number we choose called the *learning rate* to decide on the step size."

    "Let's get back to our MNIST problem. As we've seen, if we are going to calculate gradients (which we need), then we need some *loss function* that represents how good our model is. The obvious approach would be to use the accuracy for this purpose. In this case, we would calculate our prediction for each image, and then calculate the overall accuracy (remember, at first we simply use random weights), and then calculate the gradients of each weight with respect to that accuracy calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we have a significant technical problem here. The gradient of a function is its *slope*, or its steepness, which can be defined as *rise over run* -- that is, how much the value of function goes up or down, divided by how much you changed the input. We can write this in maths: `(y_new-y_old) / (x_new-x_old)`. Specifically, it is defined when x_new is very similar to x_old, meaning that their difference is very small. But accuracy only changes at all when a prediction changes from a 3 to a 7, or vice versa. So the problem is that a small change in weights from from x_old to x_new isn't likely to cause any prediction to change, so `(y_new - y_old)` will be zero. (In other words, the gradient is zero almost everywhere.) As a result, a very small change in the value of a weight will often not actually change the accuracy at all. This means it is not useful to use accuracy as a loss function. When we use accuracy as a loss function, most of the time our gradients will actually be zero, and the model will not be able to learn from that number. That is not much use at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "> s: In mathematical terms, accuracy is a function that is constant almost everywhere (except at the threshold, 0.5) so its derivative is nil almost everywhere (and infinity at the threshold). This then gives gradients that are zero or infinite, so useless to do an update of gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we want a loss function which, when our weights result in slightly better predictions, gives us a slightly better loss. So what does a \"slightly better prediction\" look like, exactly? Well, in this case, it means that, if the correct answer is a 3, then the score is a little higher, or if the correct answer is a 7, then the score is a little lower. Here is a simple implementation of just such a function, assuming that `inputs` are numbers between zero and one:"

    "We now have two terms which are somewhat similar: *loss* and *metric*. They are similar because they are both measures of how well your model is performing. The key difference, though, is that the loss must be a function which has a meaningful derivative. It can't have big flat sections, and large jumps, but instead must be reasonably smooth. Therefore, sometimes it does not really reflect exactly what we are trying to achieve, but is something that is a compromise between our real goal, and a function that can be optimised using its gradient. The loss function is calculated for each item in our dataset, and then at the end of an epoch these are all averaged, and the overall mean loss is reported for the epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics, on the other hand, are the numbers that we really care about. These are the things which are printed at the end of each epoch, and tell us how our model is really doing. It is important that we learn to focus on these metrics, rather than the loss, when judging the performance of a model."

    "In order to take an optimiser step we need to calculate the loss over one or more data items. We could calculate it for the whole dataset, and take the average, or we could calculate it for a single data item. But neither of these sounds ideal — calculating it for the whole dataset would take a very long time, but calculating it for a single item would result in a very imprecise and unstable gradient. So instead we take a compromise between the two: we calculate the average loss for a few data items at a time. This is called a *mini-batch*. The number of data items in the mini batch is called the *batch size*. A larger batch size means that you will get a more accurate and stable estimate of your datasets gradient on the loss function, but it will take longer, and you will get less mini-batches per epoch. Choosing a good batch size is one of the decisions you need to make as a deep learning practitioner to train your model quickly and accurately. We will talk about how to make this choice throughout this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good reason for using mini-batches rather than calculating the gradient on individual data items is that, in practice, we nearly always do our training on an accelerator such as a GPU. These accelerators only perform well if they have lots of work to do at a time. So it is helpful if we can give them lots of data items to work on at a time. Using mini-batches is one of the best ways to do this. (Although if you give them too much data to work on at once, they run out of memory--making GPUs happy is tricky!)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, in the discussion of data augmentation, we get better generalisation if we can very things during training. A simple and effective thing we can vary during training is what data items we put in each mini batch. Rather than simply enumerating our data set in order for every epoch, instead what we normally do in practice is to randomly shuffle it on every epoch, before we create mini batches. PyTorch and fastai provide a class that will do the shuffling and mini batch collation for you, called `DataLoader`.\n",

    "> j: There is an enormous amount of jargon in deep learning, such as: _rectified linear unit_. The vast vast majority of this jargon is no more complicated than can be implemented in a short line of code and Python, as we saw in this example. The reality is that for academics to get their papers published they need to make them sound as impressive and sophisticated as possible. One of the ways that they do that is to introduce jargon. Unfortunately, this has the result that the field ends up becoming far more intimidating and difficult to get into than it should be. You do have to learn the jargon, because otherwise papers and tutorials are not going to mean much to you. But that doesn't mean you have to find the jargon intimidating. Just remember, when you come across a word or phrase that you haven't seen before, it will almost certainly turn out that it is a very simple concept that it is referring to."

    "The basic idea is that by using more linear layers, we can have our model do more computation, and therefore model more complex functions. But there's no point just putting one linear layout directly after another one, because when we multiply things together and then at them up multiple times, that can be replaced by multiplying different things together and adding them up just once! That is to say, a series of any number of linear layers in a row can be replaced with a single linear layer with a different set of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we put a non-linear function between them, such as max, then this is no longer true. Now, each linear layer is actually somewhat decoupled from the other ones, and can do its own useful work. The max function is particularly interesting, because it operates as a simple \"if\" statement. For any arbitrarily wiggly function, we can approximate it as a bunch of lines joined together; to make it more close to the wiggly function, we just have to use shorter lines."

Most functions that can appear in a model also have identical forms that are modules. Generally, it's just a case of replacing `F` with `nn`, and changing the capitalization. When using `nn.Sequential` PyTorch requires us to use the module version. Since modules are classes, we have to instantiate them, which is why you see `nn.ReLU()` above. Because `nn.Sequential` is a module, we can get its parameters--which will return a list of all the parameters of all modules it contains.\n",

    "At this point we have something that is rather magical:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A function that can solve any problem to any level of accuracy (the neural network) given the correct set of parameters\n",
    "1. A way to find the best set of parameters for any function (stochastic gradient descent)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why deep learning can do things which seem rather magical. Believing that this combination of simple techniques can really solve any problem here is one of the biggest steps that we find many students have to take. It seems too good to be true. It seems like things should be more difficult and complicated than this. Our recommendation: try it out! We will take our own recommendation and try this model on the MNIST dataset. Since we are doing everything from scratch ourselves (except for calculating the gradients) you know that there is no special magic hiding behind the scenes…\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to stop at just two linear layers. We can add as many as we want, as long as we add a nonlinearity between each pair of linear layers. As we will learn, however, the deeper the model gets, the harder it is to optimise the parameters in practice. Later in this book we will learn about some simple but brilliantly effective techniques for training deeper models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know that a single nonlinearity with two linear layers is enough to approximate any function. So why would we use deeper models? The reason is performance. With a deeper model (that is, one with more layers) we do not need to use as many parameters; it turns out that we can use smaller matrices, with more layers, and get better results than we would get with larger matrices, and few layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that we can train them more quickly, and our model will take up less memory. In the 1990s researchers were so focused on the universal approximation theorem that very few were experimenting with more than one nonlinearity. This theoretical but not practical foundation held back the field for years. Some researchers, however, did experiment with deep models, and eventually were able to show that these models could perform much better in practice. Eventually, theoretical results were developed which showed why this happens. Today, it is extremely unusual to find anybody using a neural network with just one nonlinearity.\n",

They are not abstract concepts, but they are actual specific numbers that are in your model. Part of becoming a good deep learning practitioner is getting used to the idea of actually looking at your activations and parameters, and plotting them and testing whether they are behaving correctly.\n",
