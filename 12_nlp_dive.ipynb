    "In practice, creating accurate models from this kind of RNN is difficult. We will get better results if we call `detach` less often, and have more layers — this gives our RNN a longer time horizon to learn from, and richer features to create. But it also means we have a deeper model to train. The key challenge in the development of deep learning has been figuring out how to train these kinds of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this is challenging is because of what happens when you multiply by a matrix many times. Think about what happens when you multiply by a number many times. For example, if you multiply by two, starting at one, you get the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8,… after 32 steps you are already at 4,294,967,296. A similar issue happens if we multiply by 0.5: we get 0.5, 0.25, 0.125… and after 32 steps it's 0.00000000023. As you can see, a number even slightly higher or lower than one results in an explosion or disappearance of our number, after just a few repeated multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because matrix multiplication is just multiplying numbers and adding them up, exactly the same thing happens with repeated matrix multiplications. And a deep neural network is just repeated matrix multiplications--each extra layer is another matrix multiplication. This means that it is very easy for a deep neural network to end up with extremely large, or extremely small numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem, because the way computers store numbers (known as \"floating point\") means that they become less and less accurate the further away the numbers get from zero. The diagram in <<float_prec>>, from the excellent article [What you never wanted to know about floating point but will be forced to find out](http://www.volkerschatz.com/science/float.html), shows how the precision of floating point numbers varies over the number line:"

    "This inaccuracy means that often the gradients calculated for updating the weights end up as zero or infinity for deep networks. This is commonly refered to as *vanishing gradients* or *exploding gradients*. That means that in SGD, the weights are updated either not at all, or jump to infinity. Either way, they won't improve with training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have developed a number of ways to tackle this problem, which we will be discussing later in the book. One way to tackle the problem is to change the definition of a layer in a way that makes it less likely to have exploding activations. We'll look at the details of how this is done in <<chapter_convolutions>>, when we discuss *batch normalization*, and <<chapter_resnet>>, when we discuss *ResNets*, although these details don't generally matter in practice (unless you are a researcher that is creating new approaches to solving this problem). Another way to deal with this is by being careful about *initialization*, which is a topic we'll investigate in <<chapter_foundations>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For RNNs, there are two types of layers frequently used to avoid exploding activations, and they are: *gated recurrent units* (GRU), and *Long Short-Term Memory* (LSTM). Both of these are available in PyTorch, and are drop-in replacements for the RNN layer. We will only cover LSTMs in this book, there are plenty of good tutorials online explaining GRUs, which are a minor variant on the LSTM design."

    "LSTM (for long short-term memory) is an architecture that was introduced back in 1997 by Jurgen Schmidhuber and Sepp Hochreiter. In this architecture, there are not one but two hidden states. In our base RNN, the hidden state is the output of the RNN at the previous time step. That hidden state is then responsible for doing two things at a time:\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, RNNs are really bad at retaining memory of what happened much earlier in the sentence, which is the motivation to have another hidden state (called cell state) in the LSTM. The cell state will be responsible for keeping *long short-term memory*, while the hidden state will focus on the next token to predict. Let's have a closer look and how this is achieved and build one LSTM from scratch."

    "In this picture, our input $x_{t}$ enters on the bottom with the previous hidden state ($h_{t-1}$) and cell state ($x_{t-1}$). The four orange boxes represent four layers with the activation being either sigmoid (for $\\sigma$) or tanh. tanh is just a sigmoid rescaled to the range -1 to 1. Its mathematical expression can be written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tanh(x) = \\frac{e^{x} + e^{-x}}{e^{x}-e^{-x}} = 2 \\sigma(2x) - 1$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's go over the four neural nets (called *gates*) one by one and explain the diagram, but before this, notice how very little the cell state (on the top) is changed. It doesn't even go directly through a neural net! This is exactly why it will carry on a longer-term state.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the arrows for input and old hidden state are joined together. In the RNN we wrote before in this chapter, we were adding them together. In the LSTM, we stack them in one big tensor. This means the dimension of our embeddings (which is the dimension of $x_{t}$) can be different than the dimension of our hidden state. If we call those `n_in` and `n_hid`, the arrow at the bottom is of size `n_in + n_hid`, thus all the neural nets (orange boxes) are linear layers with `n_in + n_hid` inputs and `n_hid` outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first gate (looking from the left to right) is called the *forget gate*. Since it's a linear layer followed by a sigmoid, its output will have scalars between 0 and 1. We multiply this result by the cell gate, so for all the values close to 0, we will forget what was inside that cell state (and for the values close to 1 it doesn't do anything). This gives the ability to the LSTM to forget things about its longterm state. For instance, when crossing a period or an `xxbos` token, we would expect to it to (have learned to) reset its cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second gate is called the *input gate*. It works with the third gate (which doesn't really have a name but is sometimes called the *cell gate*) to update the cell state. For instance we may see a new gender pronoun, so we must replace the information about gender that the forget gate removed by the new one. Like the forget gate, the input gate ends up on a product, so it jsut decides which element of the cell state to update (valeus close to 1) or not (values close to 0). The third gate will then fill those values with things between -1 and 1 (thanks to the tanh). The result is then added to the cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last gate is the *output gate*. It will decides which information take in the cell state to generate the output. The cell state goes through a tanh before this and the output gate combined with the sigmoid decides which values to take inside it.\n",

This paper showed how effective use of *dropout*, *activation regularization*, and *temporal activation regularization* could allow an LSTM to beat state of the art results that previously required much more complicated models. They called an LSTM using these techniques an *AWD LSTM*. We'll look at each of these techniques in turn."

This makes sure all neurons actively work toward the output as seen in <<img_dropout>> which is a screenshot from the original paper.\n",
