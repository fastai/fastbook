    "Unfortunately, when it comes to blogging, it seems like you have to make a difficult decision: either use a platform that makes it easy, but subjects you and your readers to advertisements, pay walls, and fees, or spend hours setting up your own hosting and weeks learning about all kinds of intricate details. Perhaps the biggest benefit to the \"do-it-yourself\" approach is that you really owning your own posts, rather than being at the whim of a service provider, and their decisions about how to monetize your content in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out, however, that you can have the best of both worlds! You can host on a platform called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is free, has no ads or pay wall, and makes your data available in a standard way such that you can at any time move your blog to another host. But all the approaches I’ve seen to using GitHub Pages have required knowledge of the command line and arcane tools that only software developers are likely to be familiar with. For instance, GitHub's [own documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) on setting up a blog requires installing the Ruby programming language, using the git command line tool, copying over version numbers, and more. 17 steps in total!\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve curated an easy approach, which allows you to use an **entirely browser-based interface** for all your blogging needs. You will be up and running with your new blog within about five minutes. It doesn’t cost anything, and you can easily add your own custom domain to it if you wish to. Here’s how to do it, using a template we've created called **fast\\_template**. (NB: be sure to check the [book website](https://book.fast.ai) for the latest blog recommendations, since new tools are always coming out; for instance, we're currently working with GitHub on creating a new tool called \"fastpages\" which is a more advanced version of `fast_template` that's particularly designed for people using Jupyter Notebooks)."
