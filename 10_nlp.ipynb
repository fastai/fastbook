    "In <<chapter_intro>> we saw that deep learning can be used to get great results with natural language datasets. Our example relied on using a pretrained language model and fine-tuning it to classify those reviews. One thing is a bit different from the transfer learning we have in computer vision: the pretrained model was not trained on the same task as the model we used to classify reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we call a language model is a model that has been trained to guess what the next word in a text is (having read the ones before). This kind of task is called *self-supervised learning*: we do not need to give labels to our model, just feed it lots and lots of texts. It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to get an understanding of the English-- or other--language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [Self-supervised learning and computer vision](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications. Self-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pre-training a model used for transfer learning."

    "The language model we used in <<chapter_intro>> to classify IMDb reviews was pretrained on Wikipedia. We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better: the Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English. So instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could finetune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and *then* use that as the base for our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targetting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of IMDb, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language that seen in Wikipedia.\n",

So, why are we learning how to train a language model in detail?\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. So that is 100,000 movie reviews altogether (since there are also 25,000 labelled reviews in the training set, and 25,000 in the validation set). We can use all 100,000 of these reviews to fine tune the pretrained language model — this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review. In contrast, the pretrained model was trained only on Wikipedia articles.\n",

For instance, consider this sentence: 我的名字是郝杰瑞 (which means \"My name is Jeremy Howard\" in Chinese). That's not going to work very well with a word tokenizer, because there are no spaces in it! Languages like Chinese and Japanese don't use spaces, and in fact they don't even have a well-defined concept of a \"word\".

    "Going back to our dataset, the first step is to transform the individual texts into a stream by concatenating them together. As with images, it's best to randomize the order in which the inputs come, so at the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the entries to make a new stream (we shuffle the order of the documents, not the order of the words inside, otherwise the text would not make sense anymore).\n",

For instance, if the stream has 50,000 tokens and we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (so from 1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000...) because we want the model to read continuous rows of text (as in our example above). This is why each text has been added a `xxbos` token during preprocessing, so that the model knows when it reads the stream we are beginning a new entry.\n",

Our model will then read the mini-streams in order, and thanks to an inner state, it will produce the same activation whatever sequence length you picked.\n",

(Be sure to search online for more information about class methods if you're not familiar with them, since they're commonly used in many Python libraries and applications; we've used them a few times previously in the book, but haven't called attention to them.)

This should look a bit familiar: we had the same issue with images. In that case, we use cropping, padding, and/or squishing to make everything the same size. Cropping might not be a good idea for documents, because it seems likely we'd remove some key information (having said that, the same issue is true for images, and we use cropping there; data augmentation hasn't been well explored for NLP yet, so perhaps there are actually opportunities to use cropping in NLP too!)

Additionally, to avoid memory issues and improve performance, we will batch together texts that are roughly the same lengths (with some shuffling for the training set). We do this by (approximately, for the training set) sorting the documents by length prior to each epoch. The result of this is that the documents collated into a single batch will tend of be of similar lengths. We won't make every batch, therefore, the same size, but will instead use the size of the largest document in each batch. (It is possible to do something similar with images, which is especially useful for irregularly sized rectangular images, although as we write these words, no library provides good support for this yet, and there aren't any papers covering it. It's something we're planning to add to fastai soon however, so have a look on the book website, where we'll add information about this if and when it's working well.)\n",

    "Congratulations — you've completed all of the chapters in this book which cover the key practical parts of training and using deep learning! You know how to use all of fastai's built in applications, and how to customise them using the data blocks API and loss functions. You even know how to create a neural network from scratch, and train it! (And hopefully you now know some of the questions to ask to help make sure your creations help improve society too.)\n",

    "The knowledge you already have is enough to create full working prototypes of many types of neural network application. More importantly, it will help you understand the capabilities and limitations of deep learning models, and how to design a system which best handles these capabilities and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this book we will be pulling apart these applications, piece by piece, to understand all of the foundations they are built on. This is important knowledge for a deep learning practitioner, because it is the knowledge which allows you to inspect and debug models that you build, and to create new applications which are customised for your particular projects."
